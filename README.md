# Cleff

Cleff provides a framework for extensible handling of computational effects.

The design is heavily inspired by the Eff programming language. This project
aims to provide a proof of concept implementation of all of the examples in
[Programming with Algebraic Effects and Handlers][1] by Bauer and Pretnar.
