# Cleff

Cleff provides a framework for extensible handling of computational effects.

The design is heavily inspired by the Eff programming language. This project
aims to provide a proof of concept implementation of all of the examples in
[Programming with Algebraic Effects and Handlers][1] by Bauer and Pretnar.

## Status

The basics of handler and computation co-routines are working.

Here's a simple non-deterministic choice effect:

```clojure
(defn choose-all [c]
  (handler
    (value [x] [x])
    c
    (decide []
      (concat (continue true) (continue false)))))

(let [c (choice)]
  (handle-with (choose-all c)
    (let [x (if (effect c 'decide) 10 20)
          y (if (effect c 'decide) 0 5)]
      (- x y))))
;;=> (10 5 20 15)
```

Lots left to do:

- Polish up the syntax
- defprotocol-style defeffect
- Subroutines for coping with core.async's lexical IOC
